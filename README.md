# Introduction

Hi! This is a google extension that blocks all blue checks from Twitter. It's still a work in progress so it doesn't block everything but it should block out 90% of things. You can manually block on your account or use one of the already available blue blockers, but this is intended for people who browse without their account or aren't logged in yet.

# Whitelist Feature
Okay I hear you, your best friend has a blue checkmark, you like that one account that posts the funny cat videos, you want to talk to your favorite game developer in english so he'll block you, okay, fine, when you open your extension, you can add the user by their @identifier (@[username]) and they will not be blocked by this app.

## Installation
* Download a zip archive of this page
* Go to your extensions
* In the top right, toggle "developer mode"
* Click "load unpacked"
* After unzipping this archive, select the extracted folder
* Activate the extension in your settings if needed but after that it should run on its own. There may be a small delay on videos as technically they are still loading in your cache but I whipped this up in like 2 hours so whatever, Enjoy your peace.

## What's blocked
* If demand is high I'll change it, but right now you can only see "who" you are ignoring, but all text, videos, and pictures from a user with a blue checkmark should be unable to load. As a bonus it seems to block some ads too, wasn't even my intent but I'll take it.

## Why?
* Normally I wouldn't care and one point I did find the subscriber drama humorous but after a while certain blue checkmarks that I know I have blocked seemed to creep back into my view and I'm just tired of it, and I'm certain people are even more annoyed by them. So here's the tool

## todo
* Add a button to disable functionality if needed, user has to manually disable via extensions, which technically is the point but still...
* Some ads are coming through, add a function to block ads
* The functionality to block banners and user descriptions is not working properly, but to be fair if you're going to their page you may be interested in seeing those things, considering if this is worth the effort
* Maybe, maybe, very slight maybe add in functionality to not block content if checkmark user is replying to non-checkmark user
* <s>Maybe add some CSS to the whitelist GUI so it looks more professional</s>
* Possibly add elements next to checkmark users so you can click to block instead of typing in the name? That's an idea
