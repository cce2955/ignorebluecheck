# Ignore blue checks


Hi! This is a google extension that blocks all blue checks from Twitter. It's still a work in progress so it doesn't block everything but it should block out 99% of things. You can manually block on your account or use one of the already available blue blockers, but this is intended for people who browse with alternate accounts or aren't logged in yet that don't want to manage a huge blocklist.

# Whitelist support
Okay, maybe your friend bought a blue checkmark, maybe the person using the blue checkmark is actually supplying actually good content, I hear you, when you click on the extension, you get a whitelist manager!!! Whitelist a twitter user with a blue checkmark by adding their @ identifier (@[username]) and look at all their content with no restrictions. The rest of the checkmarks remain blacklisted. And if you somehow get tired of them? Just tap remove and you'll never see them again. This functionality is local to your device, so sorry if you want it synced across google devices. Again if demand is high enough I'll add it

# Installation
* Download a zip archive of this page
* Go to your extensions
* In the top right, toggle "developer mode"
* Click "load unpacked"
* After unzipping this archive, select the extracted folder
* Activate the extension in your settings if needed but after that it should run on its own. There may be a small delay on videos as technically they are still loading in your cache but I whipped this up in like 2 hours so whatever, Enjoy your peace.
* What's blocked
* If demand is high I'll change it, but right now you can only see "who" you are ignoring, but all text, videos, and pictures from a user with a blue checkmark should be unable to load. As a bonus it seems to block some ads too, wasn't even my intent but I'll take it.

# Why?
* Normally I wouldn't care and one point I did find the subscriber drama humorous but after a while certain blue checkmarks that I know I have blocked seemed to creep back into my view and I'm just tired of it, and I'm certain people are even more annoyed by them. So here's the tool
