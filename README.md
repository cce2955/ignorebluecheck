# Introduction

Hi! This is a google extension that blocks all blue checks from Twitter. It's still a work in progress so it doesn't block everything but it should block out 99% of things. You can manually block on your account or use one of the already available blue blockers, but this works even when you're not logged in and doesn't use any data from both google or twitter. It may use google data when I upload the extension to the extension marketplace but that's in the future

# Whitelist Feature
Okay I hear you, your best friend has a blue checkmark, you like that one account that posts the funny cat videos, you want to talk to your favorite game developer in english so he'll block you, okay, fine. 

* After installing the extension, go ahead and give "Twitter Blue Blocker Whitelist Manager" a click

<p>

* After clicking, add their @identifier in the input box and click "Add to Whitelist", this will...uh, add them to the white list

<p>

* Now this person gets a free pass to your eyeballs. Anything they post on any page from that point on, including text, video, pictures, is now free for you to consume.

## Installation
* Download a zip archive on the main page under code, or [click here](https://github.com/cce2955/ignorebluecheck/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
* Go to your extensions
* In the top right, toggle "developer mode"
* Click "load unpacked"
* After unzipping this archive, select the extracted folder
* The extension should be activated as soon as it's installed, if not you can manually activate it under "manage extensions". If you want to see the blocked users, simply go back to "Manage extensions" and turn it off, the next time you refresh a page, all the blocked content should be unblocked.

## What's blocked
* If demand is high I'll change it, but right now you can only see "who" you are ignoring, but all text, videos, and pictures from a user with a blue checkmark should be unable to load. At the moment if someone posts an external link (youtube video, news artcile, etc.) that is not blocked but I think that's fair enough since usually they link other people's videos.

## Why?
* I wouldn't be shocked if half the blue verified are bots themselves as most of them add so little to a conversation and just repost to farm views at this point. The only reason I even added the whitelist was for the few who actually do "produce content" or have insightful commentary.

## todo
* <s>Add a button to disable functionality if needed, user has to manually disable via extensions, which technically is the point but still...</s>
* Some ads are coming through, add a function to block ads
* <s>The functionality to block banners and user descriptions is not working properly, but to be fair if you're going to their page you may be interested in seeing those things, considering if this is worth the effort</s>
* Maybe, maybe, very slight maybe add in functionality to not block content if checkmark user is replying to non-checkmark user
* <s>Maybe add some CSS to the whitelist GUI so it looks more professional</s>
* Possibly add elements next to checkmark users so you can click to block instead of typing in the name? That's an idea
* Upload it to the play store
