# Ignore blue checks

Hi! This is a google extesion that blocks all blue checks from Twitter. It's still a work in progress so it doesn't block everything but it should block out 90% of things. You can manually block on your account or use one of the already available blue blockers, but this is intended for people who browse without their account or aren't logged in yet.

# Installation
Download a zip archive of this page, Go to your extensions, in the top right, toggle "developer mode", click "load unpacked", and after unzipping this archive, select this folder, activate the extension in your settings if needed but after that it should run on its own. Enjoy your peace.

# Why?
Normally I wouldn't care and one point I did find the subscriber drama humorous but after a while certain blue checkmarks that I know I have blocked seemed to creep back into my view and I'm just tired of it, and I'm certain people are even more annoyed by them. So here's the tool
